# =============================================================================
# TRIVY IGNORE LIST - WEEK 8 HA LAB (LOCALSTACK)
# =============================================================================
# This file suppresses specific security checks for the LocalStack lab environment.
# In a production environment, these risks would be remediated.
# =============================================================================

# Risk: Load Balancer is exposed to the public internet
# Reason: This is a public-facing web application demo; public access is required.
AVD-AWS-0053

# Risk: Listener uses HTTP (Port 80) instead of HTTPS (Port 443)
# Reason: LocalStack limitation. Generating valid SSL certificates for localhost is 
#         out of scope. Production must use AWS ACM + HTTPS.
AVD-AWS-0054

# Risk: Security Group allows unrestricted egress (0.0.0.0/0)
# Reason: Instances need internet access to download package updates (yum/apt).
#         In production, this would be restricted to a NAT Gateway IP or VPC Endpoint.
