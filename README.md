# Cloud Security Portfolio

This repo contains my 12-week Cloud Security roadmap:

- **Week 1–3:** Fundamentals (AWS, IAM, VPC, Terraform, CI/CD)  
- **Week 4–7:** Project A – Hardened Web App (AWS + Terraform + GitHub Actions)

- **Week 10–12:** Incident response, polish, and job applications.

## Progress

- **Week 2** – Security visibility (CloudTrail + GuardDuty) 
- **Week 3** – Terraform fundamentals — S3 example on LocalStack, notes, modules skeleton   
- **Week 4** – DevSecOps: shift-left scanning, automated remediation, and secure CI/CD gates
- **Week 5:** Project A Skeleton - Designed secure modular architecture (VPC/IAM) and validated deployment on LocalStack.
- **Week 6:** Project A Hardening - Added Observability (CloudTrail/GuardDuty) and fixed 7 critical engineering
