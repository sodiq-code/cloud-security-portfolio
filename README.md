# Cloud Security Portfolio

This repo contains my 12-week Cloud Security roadmap:

- **Week 1–3:** Fundamentals (AWS, IAM, VPC, Terraform, CI/CD)  
- **Week 4–7:** Project A – Hardened Web App (AWS + Terraform + GitHub Actions)  
- **Week 8–9:** Project B – Multi-Account Security Baseline (SCP + org logging)  
- **Week 10–12:** Incident response, polish, and job applications.

## Progress

- **Week 1** – AWS basics and networking notes  
- **Week 2** – Security visibility (CloudTrail + GuardDuty) 
- **Week 3** – Terraform fundamentals — S3 example on LocalStack, notes, modules skeleton   
- **Week 4** – DevSecOps: shift-left scanning, automated remediation, and secure CI/CD gates
