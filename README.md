# Cloud Security Portfolio

This repo contains my 12-week Cloud Security roadmap:
- Week 1–3: Fundamentals (AWS, IAM, VPC, Terraform, CI/CD)
- Week 4–7: Project A – Hardened Web App (AWS + Terraform + GitHub Actions)
- Week 8–9: Project B – Multi-Account Security Baseline (SCP + org logging)
- Week 10–12: Incident response, polish, and job applications.

## Progress

- Week 1 – AWS basics and networking notes → `docs/week1/notes.md`
- Week 2 – Security visibility (CloudTrail + GuardDuty) → `docs/week2/security-visibility-readme.md`
